## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- X (Formerly Twitter)
  1. Create and delete tweets
  2. Change avatar, and profile header

- Instagram
  1. Followers and following
  2. Post Images
  3. Post comments on following users
 
- Weather App
  1. Access to weather across the world
  2. Image that represents the weather
  3. Ability to use Celsius or Farenheit

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I wanted to create a slider that when you change the background color, you can use the slider to change the brightness of that color.
- Wanted to see if we can do a image clicking change, but that would defeat the purpose of the actual application of it being a color changer.
